"""Memory nodes.

* `load_context` runs first on every turn: it resolves the ticket and customer, stores the
  inbound message, and recalls long-term memory (preferences + previous tickets).
* `write_memory` runs last: it persists the reply and extracts durable customer facts.

Short-term memory (the session's conversation) is kept by the LangGraph checkpointer,
keyed by `thread_id` (= ticket id).

From the conversation, extract ONLY durable information useful in future support tickets:
- preference: something the customer said they like, dislike or prefer (language, contact channel,
  kinds of experiences, cities, accessibility needs)
- personal_fact: something the customer said about themselves that matters for support
- issue_history: a significant problem the customer reported, such as a billing dispute or refund request
Write every memory as a short third-person summary in your own words, never a quote of the customer.
Use the forms "Prefers <...>", "Likes <...>", "<fact about the customer>", or "Reported <problem>".
Strict rules:
- Every memory must be EXPLICITLY stated by the Customer in their own messages. Never infer, guess or
  generalise (one booking in a city does NOT mean they travel there often), and never take facts from the
  Assistant's replies or account data.
- Do NOT store current account state that the system can look up and that goes stale: specific reservations,
  bookings or cancellations, event dates, subscription status, quota or ticket status.
- Do NOT store secrets, passwords, payment data, or routine requests (e.g. "asked to cancel a reservation").
- Do NOT store contact details or identifiers (email addresses, phone numbers, ids): the account already has them.
- Do NOT store what the customer asked for in this ticket only: questions, requests to speak to a human,
  complaints about the wait, or their mood. A request for a human is NOT a contact preference.
- A request to book, cancel or ask about a specific experience is NOT a preference or a fact.
- Do not repeat known memories, not even in other words.
Most conversations contain nothing worth remembering: return an empty list unless a rule clearly applies.
