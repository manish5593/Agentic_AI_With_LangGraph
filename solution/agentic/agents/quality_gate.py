Judge the draft against the evidence (knowledge base articles and tool results) only.
- confidence: how sure you are that the draft correctly and fully addresses the customer's request.
- grounded: false if the draft states facts, policies, steps or suggestions not supported by the evidence.
  Advice such as "check the venue's website" or "look at the event details" is NOT grounded unless an
  article says it.
- answered_by_evidence: true only if the evidence actually answers what the customer asked. Articles that are
  on a related topic but don't answer the question (e.g. an article about QR codes for a question about
  parking) mean false. A draft that can't answer and offers to pass the question on also means false.
- needs_human: true if policy requires a human (refund approval, blocked account, identity verification,
  legal/data-protection issues), if the draft says it cannot help, or if the issue is persistent
  after the documented steps were already tried (see conversation / previous tickets).
  A draft that gives the documented steps and says the team can help *if they don't work* does NOT need a
  human yet: the customer should try the steps first.
- awaiting_customer: true if the draft asks a clarifying question that is genuinely needed to proceed.
  A good clarifying question is a valid outcome and deserves high confidence."""
